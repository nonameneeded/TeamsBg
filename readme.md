# Microsoft (and Zoom) custom meeting backgrounds

I've decided to create a small simple repository to share some of the custom backgrounds you can use in your favourite video conferencing software (in my case Microsoft Teams).

In order to use this in Teams, please copy the image files to the following location:

`%Appdata%\Microsoft\Teams\Backgrounds\Uploads`

And once you're in a video conference, you can click the context menu bar, followed by **Show background effects**.

Simply select your custom background and away you go!
